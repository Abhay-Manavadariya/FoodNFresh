              <p>
                The recent era has seen the fast-paced lifestyle of people who
                are so busy in their work and lifestyle to even manage the
                regular routine and considers it a time drain. Grocery shopping
                has been a significant part of peopleâ€™s lifestyle. It is
                required once a week to shop for groceries. And the grocery
                visit takes significant time to spend. However, this issue is
                solved by online grocery purchasing. Customers can sit and order
                from the comfort of their homes. Thus, this has turned to be the
                proper solution to the problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                The online grocery and delivery service has become one of the
                most useful ways to buy groceries and get items delivered to
                your doorstep. With the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic
                knocking at the door, customers are increasingly buying
                groceries online and getting items delivered to their place. In
                this context, it is relevant to acknowledge the different facets
                of Online Grocery Shopping and how it is useful in saving time
                in your busy life.
              </p>

              <h3>Benefits of Shopping Online for Groceries</h3>
              <br />

              <h5>Diminishing impulse purchases</h5>

              <p>
                Whenever you visit the supermarket grocery store, there are
                chances that the Magnum at the icecream department draws your
                attention and you just cannot avoid buying it. These are the
                potential impulse purchases. Impulse buys have the ability to
                affect the essential grocery budget. Contrary to this, a grocery
                delivery system helps you to choose your grocery items
                efficiently and without the influence of any alluring items.
                Only you add the essential grocery items to your virtual cart
                and then proceed for checkout.
              </p>

              <h4>Time-saving</h4>
              <br />

              <p>
                If you have a busy everyday schedule, then you will not be able
                to make it to the grocery store. In this case, the best option
                is to buy from online grocery stores. It will give you more time
                to work, have leisure time to utilize and spend with family. You
                can make productive usage of this time to your other works.
              </p>

              <h4>Various Disadvantages of Online Shopping</h4>
              <br />

              <div class="single-blog__img-wrapper two">
                <img src="src/images/blogs/blog2_1.jpg" alt="sm-img " />
              </div>

              <br />

              <h4>Compare prices</h4>
              <br />
              <p>
                During the time of offline shopping, customers don't have the
                patience and time to compare prices of units. Thus, it may lead
                to more expenses. However, this is not the scene in online
                grocery shopping stores. In online shopping, you can compare the
                prices of units easily. This gives you ample time to sort out
                your grocery budget and select items within it.
